MyPl-language-project

MyPl is a full programming language developed at Gonzaga CPSC326 Organization of Programming Languages
It is developed during class broken in multiple programming assignments in C++, building all the steps for a programming language to work
As a final assignment I added a transpiler to C# that could transform any MyPl program into C# and run it. This allowed to compare the speed between MyPl and C#
